App overview
Fachada is a web based painting service where the client can upload a picture of the room, or wall where you’d like to get your paint job done. People that offer painting services can contact the customer and give their budget proposal meaning how much they’d charge for their services, also the people that offers the painting service can upload pictures of the jobs they have done before and will be getting reviews of people that hired them before.
